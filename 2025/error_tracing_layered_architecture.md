#  Tittle 03:  Tracing Errors in a Layered Architecture: Lessons from Our Journey

### Abstract:
Error handling in Go is designed to be simple, explicit, and flexible. But when applied to a layered architecture, this simplicity can lead to chaos: verbose error messages, lost context, and debugging headaches that leave developers scrambling for solutions. In our journey, we struggled to trace errors through service, repository, and API layers, often ending up with cryptic logs and unclear root causes.

This talk tells the story of how we tackled error propagation and tracing in a layered architecture. From the initial frustration of Go’s “errors as values” philosophy to experimenting with structured solutions, we uncovered patterns and tools that transformed our approach.

By introducing the concept of namespaced errors, inspired by the namespace.error library, we created a system that preserved context across layers without sacrificing Go’s simplicity. Along the way, we adopted best practices, overcame pitfalls, and learned how to make errors an asset rather than a liability.

Attendees will leave with actionable insights, including:

- Why unstructured error handling falls apart in complex systems.
- How namespaced errors can provide clarity and context in layered architectures.
- Practical patterns for consistent error propagation using Go’s standard library and third-party tools.
- Integrating error handling with observability tools like OpenTelemetry to improve debugging.


This session is perfect for developers building multi-layered Go applications who want to reduce debugging time and improve system maintainability. Through storytelling, real-world examples, and live code snippets, this talk will inspire attendees to rethink their approach to error handling.****
